# software-learning-period
A repository dedicated to the team 2021-2022 to mess around with Git and to learn ROS

This repo is structured similarly to how our main Vortex-AUV repo is structured. tutorial_setup is the entrypoint for launching the entire system, while the rest of the folders here contain packages related to the folder name.
